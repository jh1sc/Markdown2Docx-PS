# Md2Docx-PS, A PowerShell Script for Converting Markdowns to Docx

This PowerShell script provides two functions for converting a markdown file to a Microsoft Word docx file. The functions `FOSD` and `FISD` are used to select a folder and a file, respectively. The script requires the `pandoc` package to be installed, which can be done using the `winget` package manager. The conversion process is executed using the `pandoc` command.
